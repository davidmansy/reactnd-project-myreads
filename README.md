# MyReads Project

This is my version of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

In addition of implementing the required Udacity specifications, I could:

- update the css to give it a Trello-like style,
- add a basic drag and drop functionality to move a book from one shelf to the other,
- add very basic unit tests (basic render and snapshot). I still need to decide if I should go for Enzyme or react-testing-library in order to write more intellegent unit tests :-)

## TL;DR

To try this project and/or improve it:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Unit tests

Launch the unit tests with `npm test`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
